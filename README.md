# Pirates

Pirates is a brazillian card game from Geeks N' Orcs where you play as a pirate and must conquer treasure cards in order
to win.

This is a fun little project of mine to write an online multiplayer card game server from scratch without googling much
solutions. The goal of it was to solve problems (and also create a few) so I can be able to design better solutions to
complex requirements.

The source code is far from perfect but I am happy with the result.

## Reading the code

After reading the games rules, I recommend start reading the code by Domain. This layer has all game rules inside it
and thus the game core.

If you are still interested in this, I recommend reading the article I have done for a special class at UFMG
(Minas Gerais Federal University).
