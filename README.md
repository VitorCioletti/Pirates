[Pirates is a brazillian card game from Geeks N' Orcs](https://geeksnorcs.com.br/piratas/)  to 2 up to 6 players where you play as a pirate and must steal treasure cards in order
to win.

This is a fun little project of mine to write an online multiplayer card game server from scratch without googling much
solutions. The goal of it was to solve problems (and also create a few) so I can be able to design better solutions to
complex requirements.

The source code is far from perfect but I am happy with the result.

## Reading the code

After [reading the game rules](https://geeksnorcs.com.br/piratas/), I recommend start reading the code by the Domain namespace. This layer has all game rules inside it
and thus the game core.

> [!TIP]
> `Rum` card allows the player to get 2 cards from the central deck. I would start reading its code.

If you are still interested in this, I recommend reading the article I have done for a class at UFMG
(Minas Gerais Federal University).
